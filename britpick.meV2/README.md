# britpick.me
===========

Quick, easy, and (slightly) customizable Britpicking for non-Brit fic authors.

## The Story

I had no British friends so  I opportunistically hijacked this project. But then I had to get British friends to help me check and update the dictionary... Something something, irony. 

## The App

Still uses "Twitter's bootstrap" or something like it? (Twitter is dead and so were some links.) Hosted on GitHub still, [here](https://jihnari.github.io/britpick.meV2/) (has some bugs). If you want to help out with any of the to-do items or tell me I'm doing British English wrong, hit me up on Tumblr or something.
