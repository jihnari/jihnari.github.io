We know a lot of you are planning to go to QCon and we hope you all have a great time. However, we also hope you'll take the proper precautions to stay safe: be aware of your surroundings, stay in public areas, make sure your phone is charged, etc. And stay hydrated!
<br/><br/>
There have been rumors that a certain group is planning a protest outside the convention center. There's no way to tell if protestors will actually show up, but the QCon organizers are aware and are prepared for this behavior: <br/>
<span class=dc-link>https://twitter.com/QCon/status/1557106614670610331?t=QQUkf6hsc43XHuuekvD5Jg&s=19</span>
<br/><br/>
If you run into anything concerning or even that you're unsure about, #curry is always full of people willing to help. Remember, QCon staff will also be there to make sure the convention stays a safe place for everyone; you can always approach them if you have questions or need help with anything.
<br/><br/>
Have a great weekend everyone!

    hypothetically, would you be up for going behind shiggy's back and taking out a yakuza organization
  <br/><span class=signal-time-right>19:40 ✓✓
  </span></span>

<dabi>
<span class=signal-box-left0>
  No
<br/><span class=signal-time-left>19:44
</span></span>

<himi>
  <span class=signal-box-right0>

  <br/><span class=signal-time-right>19:44 ✓✓
  </span></span>

<dabi>
  <span class=signal-box-left0>
    Still no
  <br/><span class=signal-time-left>19:44
  </span></span>

<himi>
  <span class=signal-box-right0>
    okay well what if i invoked the sacred right of besties, would that at least get a free pass to help me bury a body
  <br/><span class=signal-time-right>19:44 ✓✓
  </span></span>

<dabi>
  <span class=signal-box-left1>

<himi>
  <span class=signal-box-right1>

  </span><span class=signal-box-right2>
    and you OWE me after not telling me what's up with hawks 😒
  </span><span class=signal-box-right3>
    so if i HYPOTHETICALLY murdered someone, would you hypothetically help me, idk, throw it into the tokyo bay or something
  <br/><span class=signal-time-right>19:44 ✓✓
  </span></span>

<dabi>
  <span class=signal-box-left1>

  </span><span class=signal-box-left3>

  <br/><span class=signal-time-left>19:44
  </span></span>

<himi>
  <span class=signal-box-right0>
    is it working
  <br/><span class=signal-time-right>19:44 ✓✓

<dabi>
  <span class=signal-box-left0>
    Maybe
  <br/><span class=signal-time-left>19:44
  </span></span>

<himi>
<span class=signal-box-right1>
  🤩🌟⭐💫✨🥰🥰💫🙏
</span><span class=signal-box-right3>
  i'll put you down as a 'yes' for the body then
<br/><span class=signal-time-right>19:44 ✓✓
</span></span>
<later>
  <span class=signal-box-right1>
    nevermind. i guess he's not here today?
  </span><span class=signal-box-right3>
    bummer
  <br/><span class=signal-time-right>19:58 ✓✓
  </span></span>

<dabi>
  <span class=signal-box-left0>
    No murder for you, then?
  <br/><span class=signal-time-left>19:58
  </span></span>

<himi>
