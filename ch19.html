  it was only around one hundred names and there's no way to know if they're actually members of qabd or if the preluders are just being lying assholes, but it's still scary

anyway a bunch of them are at qcon now. sounds like so far theyre just staying outside and chanting dumb offensive rhymes but they havent done anything illegal so the police can't force them to disperse

  Yep! They're both really nice.

Fruit Juice(tm) @banananaanananana
you do know that only 5% of the population is quirkless right
|

*10%, but only 5% of people under <age>
_
<someone from the twitter dump?>
Have you been looking? Two of the booths in the vendor hall are being run by quirkless people, two of the upcoming panels have quirkless guests, half a dozen of the staff volunteers are quirkless.

Maybe check you facts before you open your mouth online.

veka @bigveka
so you're telling me... 10 whole quirkles people. at an event for quirkless people. prelude was right, this entire convention is just lip service.
