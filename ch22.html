    Are you aware that one of your students was involved in the QCon riot this weekend?
  </span>
</p>
<p class="sms-time">09:46</p>
<p>

  <span class="sms-box-right">
    I find "was involved in a riot" a funny way to phrase "helped de-escalate the situation".
  </span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  But I had heard, yes.
</span>


<span class="sms-box-left">
  He was involved in an official capacity without the proper licensing, which is issue enough.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  I simply find it suspicious that two of your students have been recently involved in incidents related to QAB.
</span>


<span class="sms-box-right">
  Regarding Kaminari, I appreciate the heads up. I performed my own investigation and did not find anything of note.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  You simply believe both incidents to be coincidental?
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  Yes.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-left">
  Your students are likely mixed up in something much bigger than they can handle. QAB is a dangerous organization and I advise you to take this threat seriously.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-left">
  And if they are found to be participating in illegal acts, I assure you their transgressions will not be taken lightly.
</span>

<span class="sms-box-right">
  I would like to remind you that you're talking about one teenager who you questioned without the presence of a lawyer and were unable to press any charges against, and another who helped quell a riot.
</span>
<span class="sms-box-right">
  Excuse me if I'm not taking your conspiracy theories seriously.

we took second in the competition!!!
<br/>
ngl i did think for a minute we might be able to take first place but second is already a LOT further than we were expecting
<br/>
kinda sad im not an official member but i do not have time for a club this intensive
<br/>
we're heading back early tomorrow morning
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:16</span><br />
But you had fun?
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:17</span><br />
yeah i had a blast
<br/>
i really am sorry about how qcon turned out for you tho
<br/>
i feel like i should have been there
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:19</span><br />
It's not your fault even a little bit. And everything turned out fine in the end!
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:20</span><br />
i sort of feel like maybe it kind of is, tho?
<br/>
*my fault
<br/>
like, <em>im</em> the one who's been fighting with prelude on twitter, im a big reason things kept escalating, and knew he was an asshole but i didn't think he was an asshole with the power to affect the real world like he obviously has
<br/>
i should have been a lot more careful
<br/>
esp bc you and engineman kept telling me to knock it off and be the bigger man and walk away and i just kept not doing that
<br/>
and maybe if i had things wouldn't have turned out this way
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:22</span><br />
Literally none of that is your fault. You couldn't have known how far he would take things and even if you had, you're not responsible for his fanbase and the protest and the riot. He was going to be an asshole online with or without you
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:22</span><br />
yeah. idk. maybe youre right
<br/>
i just can't help but feel like i could have changed things
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:24</span><br />
Maybe you could have and maybe you couldn't have. What matters is what we do about it now
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:25</span><br />
idk what to even do about it now
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:25</span><br />
I do :)
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:25</span><br />
should i be worried
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shuttai</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:26</span><br />
No :)

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:26</span><br />
my worry has intensified
</p>
