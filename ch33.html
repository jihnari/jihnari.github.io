<!-- 
  cosmetic todo: 
  - timestamaps 
  - gc headers (reference picture exists)
  - dabi name 
  - himiko name 
  - news section? 
  - kasumeki smth, find 
  - which ok does shouto use 
  
todo:
- **kacchan/todo, should say something that tips todo off by ch12
- fuyumi - "you are not going back there" //nix? //throw in 12?
- fix dabi shouto section 
- throw in a news section (include cowgirl) 
- finish ending crawler/shuttai section 
- crawler/bluenoise about himiko? 



done: 
- + LOL WHERE IS MIDORIYA THIS ENTIRE CHAPTER
- + kirishima?? in some capacity?? Baku saying "im still working on it" and kirishima saying "idc anymore". alt, kiri saying "what's up w kaminari" *second one *could move this to 34, kiri says it and bakugou immediately acts
- + hawks himi convo about denki? offers to help her break the law/hpsc
- //himi twitter; maybe about her relationship problems? but she talks about that a lot
- todoroki has to have some reaction to the server being gone?? maybe reaches out to a bunch of people who are perpetually offline? shuttai, crawler, engineman, bluenoise, (not rai), maybe touya lol, then finally bloodlove
- where did that section go, of shouto saying "what happened to the server" and denki saying "literally do not talk to me" //idk i lost it 
- move those two sections to 12 
-  mention a crawler update?? just that he's suffering. possibly in communications with la brava, or still just pop 
//combine these
- himiko has to find out nighteye is after denki (or has him on camera in some way) 
//can move to 12?  //moved to 12 


today is thursday (10/8)

      I'd be mad but I'm too busy being confused. It reads as a promo piece, but 1) Gentle Criminal has less than 100 subscribers, and 2) have you seen him? He wears a suit in all of the videos I've seen so far, but it's clearly seen better days. If this guy had the funds to pay off Shuttai of all people, why wouldn't he buy himself some better clothes?

      So... what the heck? Are they personal friends? Is Shuttai being blackmailed by the worst thief in the century? What is going on?

 If Shuttai could be paid off, why would he constantly be going for the HPSC's throat? He's never been in it to make friends or censor himself.

  Unless going after the HPSC was paid for by someone else. Like the League of Villains.

  I haven't been following QAB as closely for the last few months but I had to see if other people were as weirded out by that post as I was. Glad to see we're all in this insane boat together.

  I also watched some of the videos. They're not terrible (though a lot of the comedy value is accidental) but I can't find any tie between QAB and Gentle Criminal previous to [yesterday's] post. Shuttai doesn't have a twitter, but Gentle does and he's never once talked about QAB or any politics that might indicate support for QAB. La Brava makes a lot of appearances on both Gentle's videos and his twitter, and I found a few instances of her talking badly about preluders. But honestly, who doesn't hate preluders? So in conclusion, I'm just as lost as you are, OP.

 <p><span class="dc-name color-default">XCFV</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:36</span><br /> 
  damage control

    You have the gall to say that when Shuttai was directly responsible for Fat Gum's license being revoked? That's what instigated all of this.

    I'm not saying I think he planned this, that would be too much credit. And don't call me bro.
 </span><span class=tw-box-left1>
   People can be dangerous without it being purposeful. The fact of the matter is, QAB is a radical movement and Shuttai is it's leader. They listen to him. They attack the HPSC for him. Do I need to give you examples of what more they could do to hurt society?

    They might not have killed him directly but their involvement with the League of Villains is what lead to his death. Stain may not have been a good man but I don't see how you can sit there and condone murder

The recent investigations into Pro Heros Fat Gum and Ryukyu have raised several questions, including one of legality. Heroes are split on their opinions, with hero offices like Mt. Agency advocating for additional freedom and separation from the Hero Public Safety Commission, and offices like Fat Gum Agency staunchly opposed. 
<br/><br/>
"It's too early to be making any rash decisions, and the HPSC more than has their hands full right now," Fat Gum "It may be a disappointment to my fans, but I'm taking this time to reflect and grow, and others should be allowed the space to do the same." Ryukyu Agency said they were "understanding" of "the uncomfortable position" a [lawsuit] against the HPSC [cut off] 


<br/><br/>
//rm? 
After a <week> of 
Ryukyu finally responded to 
The head lawyer for Ryukyu Agency filed an [injunction] earlier today 
Ryukyu declined to comment.

Eraserhead,
 <br/><br/>
I hope this email finds you well. Unfortunately, I am reaching out to inform you that one of your students, Kaminari Denki, was a participant in yesterday's riot at [**Kasumekigamai]. Attached you will find irrefutable video proof.
<br/><br/>
As the individual in question is both a minor and a hero student under your care, I leave the disciplinary actions up to you regarding this behavior. However, should proper measures not be taken, be aware that I will be forced to take legal action.
<br/><br/>
Additionally, please inform Kaminari Denki that in the coming weeks he may be called in for questioning concerning Q.A.B.'s involvement with this incident.
<br/><br/>
Thank you,

<br/><br/>

 <br/>[**message doesnt go through, iida doesnt have his anon messages turned on **i dont think discord shows you this, i think it just silently deletes your message a few hours later]

  My apologies for the sudden contact but would you happen to know what happened to the QAB server? <br/>
  It might just be Discord connectivity issues. I can't seem to get a hold of anyone.

  it's not a connectivity issue, they deleted the server

 <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:02</span><br />

  he's been trying to message people all day i think but no one was responding!!
</p>
 
 <p><span class="dc-name color-default">XCFV</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:02</span><br /> 
  messaging like who?
</p>
 
 <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:02</span><br /> 
  Crawler, Shuttai, Engineman, among others <br/>
  Many of the messages didn't go, so I thought it was an issue with my account. But Bloodlove said the server had been deleted?
</p>
 
 <p><span class="dc-name color-default">XCFV</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:02</span><br /> 
  wdym messages didnt go through? <br/>
  oh shit i bet i know why  <br/>
  they probably have anon messages turned off and didnt even see them <br/>
  i know crawler has that setting turned off but im sure he's busy dealing with the fallout <br/>
  assuming he hasnt been arrested 
</p>
  
 <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:02</span><br />

 <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Swann</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:02</span><br /> 
  Yeah server's been nuked  <br/>
  We think it might have been the HPSC that did it but there's no way to tell

  it's a secret üòâ‚ú® <br/>
  but apparently sir nighteye the pro hero might have something to do with the server going offline? 
</p>
  
<p><span class="dc-name color-default">bluenoise</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 16:02</span><br />

    yeah i gathered
</span><span class="signal-box-right2">
  blood somehow knows details about my boss she has no right to know about
</span><span class="signal-box-right2">

<span class="signal-box-left1">
  ok im not gonna lie i have been snooping, but i havent found anything
</span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  ive met rai, he's a student at UA. so maybe bloodlove is just in the same industry as you? 
</span><span class="signal-box-left3">
  i think they're the same age tho so maybe she's an intern somewhere?

   fuck
</span><span class="signal-box-right3">

<span class="signal-box-left1">
  the hacker my friend found me is a godsend
</span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  all i have to do is find data, any mention i wish wasnt there, point them at it, and poof it goes away
</span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  its not even their quirk apparently they're just a literal wizard 
</span><span class="signal-box-left2">
  only downside is there's a shit load of incriminating crap out there

  i know you probably dont want to tell me more than absolutely necessary but if you change your mind we could add you to the list of things we're erasing from history
