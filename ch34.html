allmight reconciliation 

done: 
+ some hawks dabi section
+ sends message to dabi saying if he's murdered Himiko did it 
//- 11?,hawks hits up crawler says he pissed some major people off and if he dies crawler should break into his apartment and get eri  (and burn his porn?) then 12, gets back in with himi and says "false alarm maybe" ""maybe"?? " //could still do this, put near the end? or could ditch, too exciting for a thread we'll never tie. 
+ could bring back tumblr (maybe save it for 34, people going wild out of order, new ships 
//himi denki reconciliation? skip this and imply it for the future? 
+ mei released?
+ some section with bakugou??


== characters: 
hawks

threads to tie up: 
- +himiko and hawks, 🤝
- +denki being a jerk /intervention/reconciliation 
- anything with eri? //maybe hawks is at the office and she makes him dino nuggets so he'll come home and he says well can't argue with that 
- something with dabi/hawks, could be a himi dabi interaction saying chill ur tits. could say "my boyfriend now 🥰" "wft ur like 12" "excuse you im 17. and im going to take waayyyy better care of hawks than you ever did so suck on that" //later, himi, hawks "heads up dabi thinks we're dating maybe" "???? why???" "i was pissed off dont worry about it, just wanted to give you a heads up" 
- bakugou almost convinces deku he's not a bad person? 
- crawler fully convinces deku he's not a bad person (mostly) ("you're not a monster/like prelude")
- mei gets out of jail 
- nighteye find out about deletion hack and moves to the next stage 
- all might reconnects with nighteye 
- +mirio gets afo (future)
- +qcon gets renewed
- +qab gets deleted ? 
- SOMETHING with aizawa/teachers chat

  I'm giving you a chance to redeem yourself. You seem like a reasonable, if reactionary, person. After what happened on Tuesday, it's only a matter of time before QAB gets dismantled. 
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  A lot of people are going to go to jail for this, and if you don't want to be one of them I suggest you come forward with what you know.

  literally how

  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you simply do not understand the gravity of the situation, and not that you truly believe you and QAB have done nothing wrong. 
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>

  <p class=news-border>    
    Businesses affected by the destruction on Tuesday are working hard to rebuild and reopen—but workers say they still deserve to be paid, despite the time off. "My manager told me to wait it out and they'll tell me when I'm back on the schedule," says Kazumi Yui, a clerk at a local 7-Eleven caught up in the violence. "They don't even give me benefits, and now they want me to wait around and not get paid?" Kazumi says she'll likely be forced to quit, even though doing so will mean forfeiting the possibility of any hazard pay or back pay.

    Ryukyu Agency, Mt.

In an interview with Japan Today, Pro Hero Ryukyu had this to say: "We ask for your support and understanding. Restrictions on public quirk usage has reached a point where this isn't just about heroes being able to do their jobs anymore. It's about people being able to live their lives."

      some indication of the future, mention the meta liberation front, smth about announcing their support for the radical group known as QAB 
      The Meta Liberation Army, known more commonly as the MLA, has announced their public support for the radical group known as QAB. According to their spokesperson 
      ok no theyre pretty underground, its just destro's book 
      Meta Liberation War, by Chikara Yotsubashi
      https://myheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Meta_Liberation_War

      so rather, a group known for their belief/central whatever in their central text, the one above 

      better, 
      experts warn that this isnt the end of qab?
      though the damage for now has been contained 
      the radical terrorist group known as MLA has recently seen a resurgence in popularity
      if mla and qab merge it could sign trouble for the peaceful days of japan, blah blah

    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    well one he isnt subtle <br/>
    his twitter handle is the same as his registered hero name  <br/>
    two we've literally met irl remember? its not like its hard to find the sports festival on youtube and pick him out 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Ah.  <br/>
      I suppose you know who I am also, then?

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    uh yeah?? <br/>
    was i not supposed to  <br/>
    your name is literally... your name   <br/>
    and your family is high profile  <br/>
    and you were on TV for the UA sports fest  <br/>
    if you didn't want anyone to know maybe don't use your literal birth name as your username 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      I don't really care if people know. Though I did think the internet was large enough to afford me more anonymity. 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    well anyway back to rai  <br/>
    idk if im outting him or whatever but you know he went to the protest a few days ago? 
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    Yes  <br/>
    I gather he did something there he regrets but he didn't give me details 
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    idk what it was either but apparently nighteye does 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Nighteye? 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    sir nighteye the pro hero
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Yes I know. I'm just surprised, given that Sir Nighteye is the same pro hero to detain Kaminari for several hours <during that one event months ago>
</p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      oh shit that was him?  <br/>
      has he been holding a grudge this entire time?? dude 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    I get the impression he's not a fan of QAB
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    yeah same  <br/>
    idk what evidence or whatever nighteye has but it cant be too damning or kaminari would be in jail already  <br/>
    unless they're waiting to serve all the arrest warrants at the same time shit guess i gotta read more up on law again  <br/>
    nighteye really really wants to arrest some people <br/>
    the hpsc also haha we are so fucking screwed  <br/>
    sorry forget i said that i am thinking positive i am breathing deeply i am googling my rights  <br/>
    anyway wanted to give him a heads up and couldn't get ahold of him <br/> 
    could you forward along the message 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      I'm not sure letting him know would be the best course of action 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    um  <br/>
    why? 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Himiko says he doesn't handle emotional stress very well and that he's already "in a bad way". He's been attempting to keep a low profile following the protest. Telling him this would only cause more stress he couldn't do anything about  <br/>
      But if it becomes relevant I'll let him know  <br/>
      Or do you think I should let him know regardless?
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    idk man  <br/>
    he's your friend you probably know him better than i do but you're right that he cant really do anything more than stay out of trouble  <br/>
    ill let you know if i find out anything else 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      I appreciate it

The timing on this is too suspicious to be coincidental. Please forward the relevant information to Attorney General Kamiya and request this be added to the growing pile of evidence.

Dear Mr. Sir Nighteye, 
 <br/><br/>
We [regret] to inform you that we were unable to process your request for server data regarding server with the ID 787522828005408788. An isolated incident [yesterday evening] related to a power outage caused some server storage data to be lost. We do not expect to be able to recover this data. 
<br/><br/>
If there is anything else we can do for you at this time, please let us know. However, be aware that you will have to submit a separate request. 
<br/>

<br/><br/>

    I think a lot of people legitimately didn't know. QAB broke containment in the best and worst ways. Sure, the blog itself is popular in its own right but it's not the same level of say, the mainstream news. 
    <br/><br/>
    When the news anchor lady on NHK says things like "QAB is suspected of murder" or "QAB is assumed to be responsible for the riot" or "A piece of artwork stolen 70 years ago was donated to the smithsonian by QAB", no one thinks of that behavior being linked to a blog site. And the word "blog" never really comes up, given all the other shit going on. 
    <br/><br/>
    ...Actually, it's entirely possible the NHK lady also does not know it stands for blog.

Hey sorry I just saw this <br/>
Things have been a little insane, I'm sure you've seen the news
I don't want to say too much since I've recently learned like
Some things about internet safety <br/>
But I did want to tell you what was going on because none of this is fair to you <br/>
Crawler and I talked about it and we decided to delete the discord server because it seemed irresponsible and possibly illegal to leave it up. And in hindsight maybe we should have made an announcement about it or given people more time but with everything going on we didn't want to risk it. <br/>
I really hope for the best for everyone who was there, and I had a lot of good times in the server, but I wasn't close to anyone there like I am with you. So I wanted to tell you this all personally but also I wanted to let you know that after everything that's happened, I think it's probably best if I delete my account. <br/>
I can't tell you everything, I can't even tell you most of it, and I'm really sorry about that. You deserve a better explanation but I'm not in a position to provide it. But I wanted to say that you were a really good friend to me and I really appreciated it. <br/>
And I know all of this sounds really final but you never know! We could run into each other in real life and not even know it. So maybe this isn't the end but for now, good bye, Shouto. <br/>
I'll miss you. 
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:20 //some hours later, pot. after school (3pm)</span><br /> 
  Who is this? <br/>

  Oh 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:20 //later still</span><br /> 
  I did some research online and it looks like it's possible to restore a deleted account within a certain time frame so in the case that you decide to do that I wanted to say that I enjoyed talking with you and being your friend. <br/>
  I understand and respect your decision. And if you decide it's safe to come back, I'll be here. <br/>
  And I hope you're right <br/>
  I hope this isn't the end

<span class="line-box-left">
  ok. fine. lets say that's true
</span><span class="line-time-left">17:02

<span class="line-box-left-m">
  nothing you said was wrong. and there's a lot of people who need to step up and take responsibility for the things they did or said or let happen. and maybe you're one of those people 
</span><span class="line-time-left">17:02
</span>
<span class="line-box-left-m">
  but you can do a hell lot more of good out here than you can in jail

  even though you regret it now, you can't take it back. all you can do is learn from your mistakes and do better in the future

</span>
<span class="line-box-left-m">
  but for me, im convinced this would have happened anyway. if you hadn't done written that post, someone else would have. or at least that people would have reached the same conclusion as you did, that things need to change. because they DO need to change 
</span><span class="line-time-left">17:02
</span>
<span class="line-box-left-m">
  and change is messy and it sucks that you're at the center of all this. but maybe the best thing you can do to make up for it is to keep going. to keep telling people [whatever]
</span><span class="line-time-left">17:02
</span>
<span class="line-box-left-m">
  and i know things are hard right now but i want you to think about all of the good things you've done and all the people you've helped

  if the riot is your fault, then the server is also your fault. helping all of those people, giving people a resource when they didn't have anywhere else to go, that was your fault. it's your fault we were able to help them.
