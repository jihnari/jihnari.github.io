<!-- chapter 12 (10/9)

todo:
(hawks/deku, deku/gentle), new hot takes on all sides, etc)
smth that finally tips todoroki off that deku is shuttai
cow rancher > fix
denki apologizes to shouto (so shouto can deliver his joke)
mei released after effects? 
eri mention?
**some resolution with ryukyu and fatgum
crawler/pop/iida section?? maybe unsure about how to handle shuttai
blue? maybe the renegades + cow
need a news section i think, any final stories. maybe towards the end, have two sections of rancher cow? **add fatgum/ryukyu here prob
shouto dabi section? could be funny /maybe nix
hpsc plans/nighteye doing stuff/future of qab vs society //added some to the ne email 
allmight reconciliation 

done: 
+ some hawks dabi section
+ sends message to dabi saying if he's murdered Himiko did it 
//- 11?,hawks hits up crawler says he pissed some major people off and if he dies crawler should break into his apartment and get eri  (and burn his porn?) then 12, gets back in with himi and says "false alarm maybe" ""maybe"?? " //could still do this, put near the end? or could ditch, too exciting for a thread we'll never tie. 
+ could bring back tumblr (maybe save it for 34, people going wild out of order, new ships 
//himi denki reconciliation? skip this and imply it for the future? 
+ mei released?
+ some section with bakugou??


== characters: 
hawks
//eri (sort of)
dabi
himiko
+ denki
shouto
crawler - tied with telling deku he's not a bad person 
+ kurono/setsuno 
nighteye /yagi 
//mei 
deku 
//aizawa 
cowlady 


threads to tie up: 
- +himiko and hawks, 🤝
- +denki being a jerk /intervention/reconciliation 
- anything with eri? //maybe hawks is at the office and she makes him dino nuggets so he'll come home and he says well can't argue with that 
- something with dabi/hawks, could be a himi dabi interaction saying chill ur tits. could say "my boyfriend now 🥰" "wft ur like 12" "excuse you im 17. and im going to take waayyyy better care of hawks than you ever did so suck on that" //later, himi, hawks "heads up dabi thinks we're dating maybe" "???? why???" "i was pissed off dont worry about it, just wanted to give you a heads up" 
- bakugou almost convinces deku he's not a bad person? 
- crawler fully convinces deku he's not a bad person (mostly) ("you're not a monster/like prelude")
- mei gets out of jail 
- nighteye find out about deletion hack and moves to the next stage 
- all might reconnects with nighteye 
- +mirio gets afo (future)
- +qcon gets renewed
- +qab gets deleted ? 
- SOMETHING with aizawa/teachers chat 
- crawler should talk to bluenoise about something tie-y-up-y 
- cowlady marriage back on, twitter deleted 
- prelude moving to mexico

- shouto figures out deku is shuttai 



today is friday maybe idk

<span class=tw-box-left0>
  I'm giving you a chance to redeem yourself. You seem like a reasonable, if reactionary, person. After what happened on <riot day>, it's only a matter of time before QAB gets dismantled. 
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  A lot of people are going to go to jail for this, and if you don't want to be one of them I suggest you come forward with what you know. 
</span><span class="tw-time-left">09:16

<span class=tw-box-right0>
  literally how 
</span><span class=tw-box-right1>
  1, i wasnt at the riot, 2, i had nothing to do with the riot
</span><span class=tw-box-right1>
  3, if i DID have anything to do with it do you think id be stupid enough to leave an online trail

  4, are you threatening other randos online or is it just me, like this is clearly just fear mongering but should i feel special or do you do this a lot

<span class=tw-box-left0>
  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you simply do not understand the gravity of the situation, and not that you truly believe you and QAB have done nothing wrong. 
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  Or is  
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  Either you care nothing for your fellow members or you're so arrogant that you think nothing you've done is illegal. 
</span><span class="tw-time-left">09:16
</span>

<span class=tw-box-right0>
  my "fellow members"? are you talking about like. my mutuals on twitter 
</span><span class=tw-box-right1>
  interacting on twitter or reddit or wherever doesn't make us "cohorts". im not responsible for them, they're not responsible for me 
</span><span class="tw-time-right">09:16

<span class=tw-box-left0>
  You expect me to believe that? 
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  Kaminari Denki, <qcon girl>, Hatsune Mei (but would she count), <shurui's real name>, <maybe swann, Togata someone>, Onemu Shinya, Kodama Masaki
</span><span class=tw-box-left1>
  This is just a portion of the list of individuals we have enough evidence on to press charges against. If you're telling the truth I suppose you won't mind if we arrest them.

  <p class=news-border>    
    Businesses affected by the destruction on [day/last week] are working hard to rebuild and reopen—but workers say they still deserve to be paid, despite the time off. "My manager told me to wait it out and they'll tell me when I'm back on the schedule," says Kazumi Yui, a clerk at a 7/11 affected by the fires. "They don't even give me benefits, and now they want me to wait around and not get paid?" Kazumi says she'll likely quit, even though doing so will mean forfeiting the possibility of any hazard pay or back pay.

    hey sorry about not getting back to you yesterday, the server was deleted it's a whole mess we're working through it  <br/>
    but actually im hitting you up because of your classmate 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Which one?  <br/>
      Rai?
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    yeah  <br/>
    kaminari denki right? 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Yes <br/>
      How did you know?
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    well one he isnt subtle <br/>
    his twitter handle is the same as his registered hero name  <br/>
    two we've literally met irl remember? its not like its hard to find the sports festival on youtube and pick him out 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Ah.  <br/>
      I suppose you know who I am also, then? 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    uh yeah?? <br/>
    was i not supposed to  <br/>
    your name is literally... your name   <br/>
    and your family is high profile  <br/>
    and you were on TV for the UA sports fest  <br/>
    if you didn't want anyone to know maybe don't use your literal birth name as your username 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      I don't really care if people know. Though I did think the internet was large enough to afford me more anonymity. 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    well anyway back to rai  <br/>
    idk if im outting him or whatever but you know he went to the protest a few days ago? 
</p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    Yes  <br/>
    I gather he did something there he regrets but he didn't give me details 
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    idk what it was either but apparently nighteye does 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Nighteye? 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    sir nighteye the pro hero
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Yes I know. I'm just surprised, given that Sir Nighteye is the same pro hero to detain Kaminari for several hours <during that one event months ago>
</p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      oh shit that was him?  <br/>
      has he been holding a grudge this entire time?? dude 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    I get the impression he's not a fan of QAB
  </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    yeah same  <br/>
    idk what evidence or whatever nighteye has but it cant be too damning or kaminari would be in jail already  <br/>
    unless they're waiting to serve all the arrest warrants at the same time shit guess i gotta read more up on law again  <br/>
    nighteye really really wants to arrest some people <br/>
    the hpsc also haha we are so fucking screwed  <br/>
    sorry forget i said that i am thinking positive i am breathing deeply i am googling my rights  <br/>
    anyway wanted to give him a heads up and couldn't get ahold of him <br/> 
    could you forward along the message 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      I'm not sure letting him know would be the best course of action 
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    um  <br/>
    why? 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      Himiko says he doesn't handle emotional stress very well and that he's already "in a bad way". He's been attempting to keep a low profile following the protest. Telling him this would only cause more stress he couldn't do anything about  <br/>
      But if it becomes relevant I'll let him know  <br/>
      Or do you think I should let him know regardless?
    </p>

  <p><span class="dc-name color-default">crawler</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
    idk man  <br/>
    he's your friend you probably know him better than i do but you're right that he cant really do anything more than stay out of trouble  <br/>
    ill let you know if i find out anything else 
  </p>

    <p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 10:21</span><br /> 
      I appreciate it

    i was kind of pissed at you yesterday but ive been thinking and i get it
  </span><span class="signal-box-right2">
    i think what i was most pissed about was losing out on the opportunity to kill mr stainy myself 
  </span><span class="signal-box-right2">
    not in a weird way, i just really looked up to him you know? 
  </span><span class="signal-box-right2">
    and also i really want you and dabi to work things out, not just for me but for him because even if he's the worst sometimes he's my friend and i want him to be happy even if he might not deserve it 
  </span><span class="signal-box-right2">
    but lucky for you it's a pisces new moon [and saturn is in fucking retrograde] and i dont stand for the kind of shit nighteye is trying to pull

people going wild out of order, new ships (hawks/deku, deku/gentle), new hot takes on all sides, etc

smth about ships, gentle/shuttai

the new tumblr sexyman

no

yes 
<more pictures>

wtf where did the blog go 
|
hey.... hey guys the QAB blog is gone 
|
<unnecessarily pedantic> 
"the quirk analysis blog blog" 
|
wait the B stood for blog this whole time??
|
<gentle X shuttai 4 eva>
WHAT THE FUCK NO THEY CAN'T DO THIS I <BOLD>JUST</BOLD> MADE THIS BLOG 
|
nvm im fine with this 
#qab 
#there sure are people in the world 
#ill miss the analysis submissions tho
_
if you ship shuttai/gentle over shuttai/hawks, you're just incorrect 
|
hey why are we shipping real people
|
are you new here
/have you ever been to the internet 
#qab 
#shuttai 
#honestly im not that invested
#because i have a life and touch grass 
#but the way hawks has been defending shuttai on twitter all week is wrecking me 
#what has gentle ever done for shuttai huh 

_
can't stop thinking about that guy who didnt know the b stood for blog
|
this is about QAB
| 
im sorry did yall not know qab was a blog 
| 
I think a lot of people legitimately didn't know. QAB broke containment in the best and worst ways. Sure, the blog itself is popular in its own right but it's not the same level of say, the mainstream news. 

When the news anchor lady on NHK says things like "QAB is suspected of murder" or "QAB is assumed to be responsible for the riot" or "A piece of artwork stolen 70 years ago was donated to the smithsonian by QAB", no one thinks of that behavior being linked to a blog site. And the word "blog" never really comes up, given all the other shit going on. 

...Actually, it's entirely possible the NHK lady also does not know it stands for blog. 
|
hold up what was that last one

//pot.
<link? artwork stolen by name, returned after <time>>

<smth about cowgirl's bad apology post, maybe mentioning the insane behavior>
people really just be saying anything they want online 
-
<1>
why do people keep tagging this with qab 
-
<2>
i see now that the og post was about kawai tohru which makes a lot of sense but my first thought was also shuttai 
-
<3>
who the fuck is kawai tohru, what the fuck is going on in the tags 

[tags]
remember that one youtuber who insisted her tail was fake and subsequently got bullied off the internet 
trying to make someone prove they have a mutation quirk is beyond gross 
but also
hindsight sure is 20/20 

kawai touru
kawai touru and her fake tail 

the year is 20X4 and people on twitter are posting apologies for being the wrong kind of mutant 
what happened to gatekeeping is bad

this is just the week for internet celebs to go crazy

Dear Mr. Sir Nighteye, 
 
We <regret> to inform you that we were unable to process your request for server data regarding server with the ID 787522828005408788. An isolated incident <yesterday evening> related to a power outage caused some server storage data to be lost. We do not expect to be able to recover this data.

Best,

Hey sorry I just saw this <br/>
Things have been a little insane, I'm sure you've seen the news
I don't want to say too much since I've recently learned like
Some things about internet safety <br/>
But I did want to tell you what was going on because none of this is fair to you <br/>
Crawler and I talked about it and we decided to delete the discord server because it seemed irresponsible and possibly illegal to leave it up. And in hindsight maybe we should have made an announcement about it or given people more time but with everything going on we didn't want to risk it. <br/>
I really hope for the best for everyone who was there, and I had a lot of good times in the server, but I wasn't close to anyone there like I am with you. So I wanted to tell you this all personally but also I wanted to let you know that after everything that's happened, I think it's probably best if I delete my account. <br/>
I can't tell you everything, I can't even tell you most of it, and I'm really sorry about that. You deserve a better explanation but I'm not in a position to provide it. But I wanted to say that you were a really good friend to me and I really appreciated it. <br/>
And I know all of this sounds really final but you never know! We could run into each other in real life and not even know it. So maybe this isn't the end but for now, good bye, Shouto. <br/>
I'll miss you. 
</p>


<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:20 //some hours later, pot. after school (3pm)</span><br /> 
  Who is this? <br/>
  Shuttai? <br/>
  Oh 
</p>

<p><span class="dc-name color-default">Shouto</span> <span class="dc-time-stamp">Today at 15:20 //later still</span><br /> 
  I did some research online and it looks like it's possible to restore a deleted account within a certain time frame so in the case that you decide to do that I wanted to say that I enjoyed talking with you and being your friend. <br/>
  I understand and respect your decision. And if you decide it's safe to come back, I'll be here. <br/>
  And I hope you're right <br/>
  I hope this isn't the end

//10-30min later
I did what I had to 

And what the fuck was that 


//blah blah cant be friends as shuttai bc shuttai committed crimes and is a bad person. IZUKU is a bad person but at least izuku wont bring anyone down with him. for now. 



<bakugou>
Your weakass mental state is your own fucking problem but youve got some shit backwards

Did you set that fire personally?
Did you break all those windows? Did you steal that merchandise? Did you punch that cop with your own fists?
I know you didn't because you have pathetic noodle arms. Go to the gym for once in your life you weakass dweeb
People are gonna do whatever the fuck they want. Them using your words as an excuse doesn't make it your problem

<deku>
It literally does
If I had never written those things, none of this would be happening
That's literally the definition of culpability

Deku thinks he's god over here
You got your head so far up your ass you think you control the weather too?
Listen
Crazies are gonna do whatever the fuck crazies are gonna do
They're just using you as an excuse

//more here, maybe change deku's mind


//kacchan is insulting but says something thoughtful and actually helpful, almost by mistake but not actually. takes deku by surprise?

Thanks for all the lawyers??

I'm still going through all the missed calls on my phone (they took it away while I was in questioning) but whoever paid the lawyer who thought to call all of the stations in Tokyo, I owe you lunch

<fruit?>
welcome back!! 
what you missed: QAB is in shambles and possibly defunct, Shuttai may have run away to get married or may have just been kidnapped, <ryukyu announced smth, war against the hpsc>, <and Kawai Touru deleted her twitter account >

<mido>
Could you tell Kacchan I've blocked him and he's in time-out for 24h, thanks 

<shouto> 
Ok 

<mido>
Sorry I forgot I sent that I was just really mad at him 
I don't mean to make you keep acting as a go between, that's really childish of both of us 
He's just!! So frustrating!!! 

<shouto>
I don't mind

//asks about legal trouble? if anything's better now? 
//say something that shouto puts together later? //happens before deku/crawler final convo, middle-ish of the chapter

//shouto is feeling down bc of the shuttai thing and deku picks up on it and says smth that potentially gives him away

12__10 //5pm 
//after deku talks to bakugou (is unconvinced but slightly swayed)
deku feeling bad for himself/thinking he's like prelude
crawler cant really refute that but he says the whole bit about how everyone's responsible for their own actions
//delete this from 11, stick to only 12? crawler is busy
<crawler>
finally some good news, i think we're officially out of the legal ramifications splash zone
you're good right? you're not still thinking of turning yourself in?

<deku>
Idk
I guess no 
I don't think I could do that to my mother
But I also don't think it's right that any of this happened
And that I caused it

you didn't cause it 

I quite literally did

can i call? 

No, sorry
Watching TV with mom 
She already thinks I've been acting weird so I don't want to act any more weird 

ok 
look 
you didn't hurt anyone and you didn't mean for anyone to get hurt 
you never wanted any of this to happen 

It doesn't matter what I wanted it matters what I did 
And what I did was point a bunch of angry people at a target 


//crawler has been thinking about this for the last few days and he has smth to say about it and the nature of responsibility /culpability 



<crawler>

intentions do matter, to a degree

but what matters more is the individual. they all made a choice, even if that choice was informed by something you said.
//can i say "and thats a beautiful/very human thing to do, whether its you or prelude"?

outro
12__10/8 //last last 
//update this, denki and todo are on bad terms. either denki apologizes right here, or todo goes to himiko instead who is enthusiastic but has no idea what todo is talking about. but he'd rather talk to denki.
//last post
denki/todo, line/text, late in the day:
Hey
Bakugou let me know I was being an ass
And I guess I kind of was
Sorry

Are you talking to me again?

Look I know I haven't been the best friend to you the last few days but you don't have to throw my apology in my face
Fine I get it, it was a shitty apology
I really am sorry though
I've been freaking out about everything that's been happening and you didn't deserve me lashing out at you

So 
We really are talking again?

Todoroki what more do you want from me?
I said I was sorry

I want to know if you're talking to me again
Because you got mad last time I tried to talk to you

I'm sorry for getting mad, ok?

Ok
First, you should text Himiko. She's been very worried. 
Second, I don't have anyone else to tell this to 

You've been talking to Himiko??
Wait tell what to

Shuttai is Midoriya

What

It's so obvious in hindsight.
//finish


//blah fix 
The college classes, the quirkless advocating, his extensive knowledge on heroes, CHIBA
/bakugou going on about his "online secret"
/his secrets, his recent vague trouble with the authorities, the way shuttai barely talked to me after i met midoriya in person
How has no one else figured this out?
//wait. someone has. bakugou must know.
