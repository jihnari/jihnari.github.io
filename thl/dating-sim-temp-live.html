<!-- notes: 
-  "thoughts" does not require pov-open or target2 etc, but is coded to kill the stuff around it if its there. thoughts would ONLY require pov-open if the first thing takumi does upon arriving to a scene is "thoughts", as pov-open brings takumi-box to display:flex. (but the current behavior of takumi-box is to stay open forever once open)
- script says thought, code says thoughts. python parser accounts for that but just making a note here anyway. 
- narration DOES exist but i dont think its every used? test during a black room ig 
- cage eito is closer (and also has bars). gonna draw bars.


TODO/REMEMBER: 
- add black-name-box to every .black view
 -->



 <!-- an: 

  there is no going back. there is only forward!! i initially wanted to have a log like the game does, but it would literally double the word count (and also be a ton of effort to try and code). 

  pot;
  for the first choice menu: it's a. little broken. maybe go in order,,, 

  save points: 
  please play the game through once! these save points are also not linked directly to the choice menu, due to coding limitations. they'll only take you to the nearest room change after having made that choice. 
  you get one (1) save point use. if you need another, refresh the page. this is because of ao3 limitations and also i didnt want to do any error handling.

  i have no CGs and as such when the screen goes black i need you to just picture a CG in your mind's eye. work with me here. i didnt have time to also learn art on top of this. 


  SPOILERS FOR: 
  the first ending (route0)
  the first 25 days of the romance route 

  if you havent gotten to the romance route yet, a quick primer: 
  spare eito, keep your secret, fall off the roof and get memory loss about the SF route, and have a dream where you kiss kyoshika, tsubasa, and kurara. you find all three girls arguing in the cafeteria over you, as apparently they all had dreams about kissing you. what will you tell them? it seems like a bad idea to tell them the truth...
